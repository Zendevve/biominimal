# BioMinimal

BioMinimal is a stripped-down, hyper-fast, and aesthetic link-in-bio builder. No fluff, just essential identity management.

## Overview

BioMinimal allows users to create a personalized "link in bio" page that is performant, privacy-focused, and easy to export. The resulting page is a single static HTML file that can be hosted anywhere.

## Key Features

*   **Visual Editor**: Real-time preview of your bio page.
*   **Themes**: Switch between multiple aesthetic presets (Paper, Obsidian, Editorial, Electric).
*   **SEO Optimized**: Customize meta titles, descriptions, and Open Graph images.
*   **Exportable**: Generates a standalone `index.html` file containing all assets and styles.
*   **Responsive**: Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## How to Use

1.  **Edit Profile**: Upload an avatar, set your name and bio.
2.  **Add Links**: Create links with custom icons, colors, and toggle visibility.
3.  **Customize**: Choose a theme and optionally add custom CSS.
